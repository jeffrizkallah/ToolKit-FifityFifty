# Story Workflow Implementation Summary

**Implementation Date:** 2025-10-08  
**Implemented By:** BMAD Master  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## What Was Implemented

A comprehensive story workflow system has been implemented to manage user stories with clear statuses, agent responsibilities, and integrated documentation. All reviews and notes are now contained within the story files themselves, creating a cleaner and more organized project structure.

---

## New Story Status System

Stories now progress through the following statuses:

```
📋 Backlog → 🚧 In Progress → 🔍 Ready to Review by QA → ✅ Approved → ✅ Done
                                          ↓
                                  ⚠️ Changes Requested
                                          ↓
                                  🔍 Ready to Review by QA (again)
```

### Status Definitions

| Status | Description | Who Sets It |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| 📋 Backlog | Story defined but not started | PM/Architect |
| 🚧 In Progress | Development work underway | Dev Agent |
| 🔍 Ready to Review by QA | Implementation complete | Dev Agent |
| ⚠️ Changes Requested | QA found issues | QA Agent |
| ✅ Approved | QA review passed | QA Agent |
| ✅ Done | Story completed & closed | BMAD Master |
| 🚫 Blocked | Waiting on dependencies | Any Agent |
