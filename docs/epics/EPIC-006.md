# EPIC 6: Post-MVP Enhancements

**Epic ID:** EPIC-006  
**Epic Goal:** Implement additional engagement features based on user feedback and roadmap (optional post-launch features).  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Phase:** Post-Launch (Week 5+)  
**Story Points:** 15  
**Owner:** Frontend Team

## Description

Add user engagement features after MVP launch, including localStorage-based progress tracking, client-side search and filter functionality, and a centralized resource library page. These features enhance the user experience but are not critical for launch.

## Key Deliverables

- LocalStorage progress tracker (mark modules as complete)
- Progress indicator component
- Client-side search functionality
- Filter by topic/keyword
- Resource library page (centralized hub for all downloads)

## Success Criteria

- Progress persists across browser sessions
- Visual progress indicators accurate
- "Mark as Complete" button working
- Search returns relevant results
- Filter narrows down content effectively
- Resource library lists all available resources

- Use localStorage for progress tracking (no backend needed)
- Implement search using Fuse.js or similar client-side library
- Resource library aggregates all downloadable content across phases
- These features can be added incrementally after launch
