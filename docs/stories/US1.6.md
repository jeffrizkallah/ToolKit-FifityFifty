# US1.6: Internationalization Framework (next-intl)

**Story ID:** US1.6  
**Epic:** EPIC-001 (Project Foundation)  
**Story Points:** 5  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** US1.3  
**Status:** ✅ Approved

## User Story

**As a** Visitor  
**I want to** switch between English and Arabic instantly  
**So that** I can read content in my preferred language

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] next-intl installed and configured
- [x] Locales configured (en, ar)
- [x] Locale routing working (`/en/...`, `/ar/...`)
- [x] Translation files created (`/messages/en.json`, `/messages/ar.json`)
- [x] Language switching works without page reload
- [x] Default locale set to English
- [x] Browser language detection working (optional)

## Technical Notes

- Install `next-intl` package
- Create middleware for locale detection
- Set up translation file structure: `/messages/{locale}.json`
- Use `useTranslations()` hook in components
- Configure `i18n.ts` with locale settings

## Implementation Summary

The next-intl framework has been fully configured for internationalization support:

### Deliverables Created:
1. **i18n.ts** - Core internationalization configuration with locales (en, ar), locale names, directions, and helper functions
2. **i18n/request.ts** - Server-side next-intl configuration for message loading
3. **middleware.ts** - Locale detection and routing middleware with browser language detection
4. **messages/en.json** - English translation file with HomePage, Navigation, and Common translations
5. **messages/ar.json** - Arabic translation file with complete RTL translations
6. **app/[locale]/layout.tsx** - Locale-aware layout with NextIntlClientProvider and dir attribute support
7. **app/[locale]/page.tsx** - Example page using useTranslations hook

### Key Features Implemented:
- next-intl v3.15.0 installed and configured
- Locale routing with `/en/` and `/ar/` prefixes
- Automatic locale detection from Accept-Language header
- Default locale set to English
- Translation system using JSON files
- Support for both LTR and RTL text directions

### Configuration Details:
- Middleware configured to match all routes except API, _next, and static files
- localePrefix set to 'always' to ensure locale appears in URLs
- localeDetection enabled for browser language detection
- Static rendering enabled for both locales

## QA Review

**Reviewed By:** QA Agent  
**Review Date:** 2025-10-17  
**Result:** ✅ APPROVED

### Test Results

#### Acceptance Criteria Verification
- ✅ **next-intl installed and configured** - Verified v3.15.0 in package.json
- ✅ **Locales configured (en, ar)** - Verified in i18n.ts with proper type definitions
- ✅ **Locale routing working** - Verified middleware.ts with proper locale detection and routing
- ✅ **Translation files created** - Both messages/en.json and messages/ar.json exist with proper structure
- ✅ **Language switching works without page reload** - Client-side navigation confirmed
- ✅ **Default locale set to English** - Confirmed in i18n.ts (defaultLocale = 'en')
- ✅ **Browser language detection working** - Verified in middleware.ts (localeDetection: true)

#### Implementation Quality Checks
- ✅ **next.config.mjs** properly configured with next-intl plugin
- ✅ **i18n/request.ts** uses getRequestConfig with proper locale validation
- ✅ **middleware.ts** has correct matcher pattern excluding API routes and static files
- ✅ **app/[locale]/layout.tsx** implements NextIntlClientProvider with dir attribute support
- ✅ **app/[locale]/page.tsx** demonstrates useTranslations hook usage
- ✅ **Translation files** have consistent structure with HomePage, Navigation, and Common sections
- ✅ **Arabic translations** are properly localized with RTL-appropriate content
- ✅ **Static rendering** enabled with generateStaticParams and setRequestLocale

#### Code Quality
- ✅ Proper TypeScript types defined
- ✅ Helper functions provided (isValidLocale, getOppositeLocale)
- ✅ Clear code documentation with JSDoc comments
- ✅ Error handling with notFound() for invalid locales
- ✅ Follows Next.js App Router conventions

### Issues Found
None - implementation is complete and meets all requirements.

### Recommendations
1. Consider adding more translation keys as new features are developed
2. Add unit tests for i18n utility functions (optional for future)
3. Document translation key naming conventions (optional)

### Conclusion
The internationalization framework is fully functional and production-ready. All acceptance criteria are met with high-quality implementation. The framework provides a solid foundation for bilingual (EN/AR) content throughout the application.
