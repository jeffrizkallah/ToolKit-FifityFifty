- **Prev/Next Navigation**: Cards showing previous and next modules within the same phase
- **Back to Phase Link**: Easy navigation back to parent phase
- **RTL Support**: Full RTL layout support with directional arrows and proper text alignment

**Technical Implementation:**
- Uses `getModuleBySlug` and `getModulesByPhase` from CMS client
- Implements proper 404 handling with `notFound()`
- Resource URLs support both file_url and uploaded file media
- Video embed conversion handles YouTube and Vimeo URLs
