# US3.7: Phase Detail Page Template

**Story ID:** US3.7  
**Epic:** EPIC-003 (Core Pages & Navigation)  
**Story Points:** 8  
**Priority:** High  
**Dependencies:** US3.2, US2.6  
**Status:** ✅ Approved

## User Story

**As a** User  
**I want to** view a phase detail page with all modules for that phase  
**So that** I can explore specific topics within the phase

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Phase detail page created (`/app/[locale]/phase/[slug]/page.tsx`)
- [x] Dynamic route fetches phase data by slug
- [x] Phase header with title, description, and optional video
- [x] Module cards displayed in grid (4-6 modules)
- [x] Progress indicator showing phase number (e.g., "Phase 2 of 6")
- [x] "Next Phase" button navigating to next phase
- [x] ISR enabled with revalidation
- [x] Works in both locales

## Technical Notes

- Use Next.js `generateStaticParams` for all phases
- Fetch phase and related modules from CMS
- Implement ISR with 60-second revalidation
- Show loading skeleton while data loads

## Implementation Summary

Created a comprehensive phase detail page with dynamic routing, module display, and navigation features.

**Components Created:**
- `app/[locale]/phase/[slug]/page.tsx` - Main phase detail page with dynamic routing
- `components/ModuleCard.tsx` - Module card component for displaying individual modules

**Key Features:**

**Dynamic Routing & ISR:**
- ✅ Dynamic route `/[locale]/phase/[slug]` for individual phase pages
- ✅ `generateStaticParams` generates static pages for all phases in both locales
- ✅ ISR enabled with 60-second revalidation (`export const revalidate = 60`)
- ✅ Fetches phase data by slug using `getPhaseBySlug()`
- ✅ Fetches related modules using `getModulesByPhase()`
- ✅ 404 page shown if phase not found

**Phase Header Section:**
- ✅ Gradient blue background matching brand colors
- ✅ Progress indicator badge (e.g., "Phase 2 of 6")
- ✅ Large phase title and HTML-rendered description
- ✅ Optional video button linking to phase video
- ✅ Large phase number display in circular badge
- ✅ Two-column responsive layout

**Modules Section:**
- ✅ Grid layout: 3 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile
- ✅ ModuleCard components with hover effects
- ✅ Each card shows: title, summary preview, video indicator (if video exists)
- ✅ Click to navigate to module detail (ready for future implementation)
- ✅ Framer Motion animations on scroll
- ✅ Empty state message when no modules exist

**Navigation Features:**
- ✅ "Next Phase" section at bottom with phase preview
- ✅ Button navigates to next phase slug
- ✅ Hidden on last phase (no next phase)
- ✅ "Back to Home" link for easy navigation
- ✅ Proper RTL icon orientation (arrows flip for Arabic)

**SEO & Metadata:**
- ✅ Dynamic metadata generation with phase title and description
- ✅ Canonical URLs and language alternates
- ✅ Proper Open Graph support

**Internationalization:**
- ✅ Full support for English (LTR) and Arabic (RTL)
- ✅ All text properly translated
- ✅ RTL-aware icon placement and arrow directions
- ✅ Locale-specific content fetching

**Styling & UX:**
- ✅ Brand colors: #0063AF (primary blue), #EC1C24 (accent red)
- ✅ Responsive design across all screen sizes
- ✅ Smooth hover effects and transitions
- ✅ Proper spacing and visual hierarchy
- ✅ Accessible with proper semantic HTML

**Integration:**
- ✅ Updated `PhaseCard.tsx` to link to correct route (`/phase/` instead of `/phases/`)
- ✅ Uses existing CMS client functions
- ✅ Follows project structure and patterns

## Deliverables

1. ✅ Created `app/[locale]/phase/[slug]/page.tsx` - Phase detail page with full functionality
2. ✅ Created `components/ModuleCard.tsx` - Module card component
3. ✅ Updated `components/PhaseCard.tsx` - Fixed link to use correct route
4. ✅ Installed `framer-motion` - For animations (already present)
