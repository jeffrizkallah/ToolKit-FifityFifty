# US3.10: Breadcrumb Navigation

**Story ID:** US3.10  
**Epic:** EPIC-003 (Core Pages & Navigation)  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Dependencies:** US3.7, US3.9  
**Status:** ✅ Approved

## User Story

**As a** User  
**I want to** see breadcrumb navigation on phase and module pages  
**So that** I understand where I am in the site hierarchy and can navigate back easily

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Breadcrumb component created (`/components/Breadcrumb.tsx`)
- [x] Shows: Home > Phase Name > Module Name
- [x] Each segment is clickable (navigates to that level)
- [x] Current page is not clickable
- [x] Works in both locales with proper RTL
- [x] Responsive design

## Technical Notes

- Use Next.js `usePathname` to generate breadcrumbs
- Style with muted colors for hierarchy
- Use chevron separators (flip direction for RTL)
- Display on phase and module pages

## Implementation Summary

The Breadcrumb component has been fully implemented and integrated:

**Deliverables:**
- Created `/components/Breadcrumb.tsx` as a reusable client component
- Integrated into phase detail page (`/app/[locale]/phase/[slug]/page.tsx`)
- Integrated into module detail page (`/app/[locale]/phase/[slug]/module/[moduleSlug]/page.tsx`)

**Key Features:**
- **Flexible Item Structure**: Accepts array of breadcrumb items with label, href, and isCurrentPage props
- **RTL Support**: Automatically flips chevron direction (ChevronLeft for RTL, ChevronRight for LTR)
- **Accessibility**: Includes proper ARIA attributes (`aria-label`, `aria-current="page"`)
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Muted colors for parent items, bold for current page
- **Hover Effects**: Clickable items have hover state with brand color (#0063AF)
- **Non-clickable Current Page**: Current page displayed as text, not a link

**Integration:**
- Phase pages show: Home > Phase Name
- Module pages show: Home > Phase Name > Module Name
- All navigation paths are properly localized (English/Arabic)
- Chevron separators automatically adjust direction based on locale

**Styling:**
- Text size: `text-sm` for compact display
- Colors: gray-600 for links, gray-900 for current page, gray-400 for separators
- Hover: Transitions to brand blue (#0063AF)
