   - All Files, PDF, Excel, Word, Other
   - Shows count for each type
   - Instant filtering

✅ **Full-Text Search**:
   - Searches resource titles
   - Searches descriptions
   - Searches module and phase names
   - Minimum 2 characters
   - Real-time results

✅ **Rich Resource Display**:

   - Download button with icon

✅ **Results Counter**:
   - Shows filtered vs total count
   - Updates in real-time
   - "Showing X of Y resources"

✅ **Clear Filters**: Easy reset button when filters active

✅ **Empty States**:
   - No resources match filters
   - No resources available

✅ **Bilingual Support**: 
   - All text uses translations
   - RTL support for Arabic
   - Localized routes

✅ **Responsive Design**:
   - Mobile-friendly layout
   - Flexible filter buttons
   - Touch-friendly interactions

✅ **SEO Optimized**:
   - Server-side rendering
   - Metadata for search engines
   - Semantic HTML structure

### File Type Icons

Each file type has a distinctive icon:
- **PDF**: Red FileText icon
- **Excel**: Green Sheet icon  
- **Word**: Blue File icon
- **Other**: Gray File icon

### Search Algorithm

The search is comprehensive and searches across:
1. Resource title (highest priority)
2. Resource description
3. Module title (for context)
4. Phase title (for context)

Searches are case-insensitive and match partial strings.

### Grouping Logic

Resources can be dynamically regrouped:

```typescript
// By Phase
"Phase 1: Discovery" → [resource1, resource2, ...]

// By Module
"Phase 1: Discovery › Module 1: Introduction" → [resource1, ...]

// By File Type
"PDF" → [resource1, resource2, ...]
"Excel" → [resource3, ...]
```

### Usage Examples

```tsx
// Access the page
<Link href="/en/resources">View All Resources</Link>
<Link href="/ar/resources">عرض جميع الموارد</Link>

// Use the hook directly
const {
  filteredResources,
  fileTypeFilter,
  handleFileTypeChange,
  handleSearchChange,
  groupedResources
} = useResourceLibrary(phases);

// Render resource card
<ResourceCard
  resource={resource}
  locale="en"
  onDownload={handleDownload}
  showContext={true}
/>
```

### Translations Added

Resources namespace in both `en.json` and `ar.json`:
- pageTitle, pageDescription
- download, allFiles
- searchPlaceholder, filterByType
- groupBy, byPhase, byModule, byFileType
- showing, of, resources
- clearAllFilters, noResourcesMatch, noResourcesAvailable

### Performance Considerations

- Resources are aggregated once on mount
- Filtering and search happen client-side for instant results
- Sorting by phase number ensures logical order
- No pagination needed initially (client-side filtering is fast)

### Analytics Integration

Downloads are tracked using the existing `trackDownload()` function from `lib/analytics.ts`, maintaining consistency with US4.5.

### Future Enhancements

- Pagination for 100+ resources
- Advanced filters (date added, file size range)
- Bulk download functionality
- Favorites/bookmarks
- Recent downloads section

### Test Architecture Assessment

**CRITICAL GAP**: No tests exist - particularly important for data aggregation logic

**Required Test Coverage:**

**P0 - Critical Tests (MISSING):**
1. **Hook Tests** for useResourceLibrary:
   - Resource aggregation from nested structure (phases → modules → resources)
   - Context preservation (phaseTitle, moduleTitle, slugs added correctly)
   - File type filtering works correctly
   - Search filtering across title/description/context
   - Combined filtering (file type + search)
   - Grouping by phase generates correct groups
   - Grouping by module generates correct groups
   - Grouping by file type generates correct groups
   - File type counts calculated accurately
   - Sorting by phase number works

2. **Component Tests** for ResourceCard:
   - Renders resource data correctly
   - File type icon displays (PDF/Excel/Word/Other)
   - Download button triggers callback
   - Context breadcrumb displays correctly
   - File size displays when available
   - Hover effects apply

3. **Component Tests** for FileTypeFilter:
   - All file type buttons render
   - Selection changes active state
   - Counts display correctly
   - Active state styling applied

4. **Component Tests** for ResourceSearch:
   - Input value controlled
   - Clear button appears/disappears
   - onChange triggered with debounce

5. **Component Tests** for GroupBySelector:
   - Dropdown displays 3 options
   - Selection triggers onChange
   - Current value displayed

6. **Page Tests** for resources/page.tsx:
   - Server component renders
   - Metadata generated correctly
   - Phases fetched on server
   - Client component receives data

**P1 - Important Tests (MISSING):**
- Empty state (no resources available)
- Empty results (filters match nothing)
- Edge case: Resource missing required fields
- Edge case: Module with no resources
- Performance with 100+ resources

**Integration Tests (MISSING):**
- Full page integration (server + client components)
- Download tracking analytics
- Search + filter combination
- Grouping + filtering combination

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Excellent, follows Next.js 14 patterns
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Proper app directory structure
- **Testing Strategy**: ✗ **NO TESTS EXIST** - critical for data aggregation
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All 7 ACs fully implemented

### Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

**Security: PASS** ✓
- Server-side data fetching (no client-side API exposure)
- Download links use CMS-provided URLs (trusted source)
- No user file uploads
- No XSS vectors (controlled data from CMS)

**Performance: VERY GOOD** ✓
- **SSR**: Page pre-rendered on server (fast initial load)
- **Client-side filtering**: Instant results (<10ms)
- **Aggregation**: O(n*m) complexity acceptable for scale
- **No pagination**: Acceptable for MVP (<100 resources expected)

**Performance Considerations**:
- At 100+ resources: Consider virtualized list or pagination
- Search could use Web Worker if dataset grows significantly
- File type counts recalculated on every filter change (minor optimization opportunity)

**Reliability: PASS** ✓
- Defensive programming (optional chaining for nested data)
- Graceful handling of missing resources
- Empty states handled
- No error-prone operations

**Maintainability: EXCELLENT** ✓
- Clean separation: hook → components → page
- ResourceWithContext type makes context explicit
- Easy to add new file types
- Easy to add new grouping options
- Well-documented code

**Usability: EXCELLENT** ✓
- Multiple ways to organize content (grouping)
- Combined filtering (type + search)
- Visual file type indicators (colors + icons)
- Breadcrumb trail shows context
- Results counter provides feedback
- Clear filters button

**SEO: EXCELLENT** ✓
- Server-side rendering for crawlers
- Metadata (title, description)
- Semantic HTML structure
- Localizable routes (/en/resources, /ar/resources)

### Technical Debt Identification

1. **Missing Tests** (CRITICAL PRIORITY)
   - Complex data aggregation needs validation
   - Risk: Incorrect context mapping
   - Risk: Filtering/grouping logic errors

2. **No Pagination** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - Current: All resources loaded at once
   - Acceptable for MVP (<100 resources)
   - Consider: Virtual scrolling or pagination at 100+ resources
   - Document: Performance note included in story ✓

3. **File Type Counts Recalculation** (LOW PRIORITY)
   - Counts recalculated every render (useMemo dependency)
   - Minor performance impact
   - Optimization: Memoize separately from filters

4. **No Error Handling for Failed Downloads** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - Download link is direct <a> tag
   - No feedback if download fails
   - Consider: Toast notification for errors

5. **Search Not Debounced in Hook** (LOW PRIORITY)
   - ResourceSearch component has clear button
   - No built-in debounce like SearchInput (US6.3)
   - Minor: User can type fast and cause multiple re-filters

6. **Missing Fuse.js Dependency** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Used in US6.3 but not listed in package.json reviewed
   - Must verify dependency installation

### Refactoring Performed

**None** - Code quality is excellent. No immediate refactoring needed.

### Security Review

✓ **No security concerns identified**

**Analysis:**
- Data sourced from trusted CMS (Strapi)
- No file uploads or user-generated content
- Download URLs from CMS (assumed validated)
- Server-side data fetching prevents direct API exposure

**Recommendation:**
- Verify CMS validates/sanitizes resource file URLs
- Consider Content-Security-Policy headers for downloads

### Performance Considerations

**Current Performance: EXCELLENT** ✓

**Load Time Benchmarks** (estimated):
- Initial SSR: <200ms
- Client hydration: <100ms
- Resource aggregation: <10ms (50 resources)
- Filter/search operation: <5ms
- Grouping operation: <10ms

**Scalability Analysis**:

| Resources | Performance | Recommendation |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| <50 | Excellent | Current approach optimal |
| 50-100 | Very Good | Monitor performance |
| 100-200 | Good | Consider pagination |
| >200 | Concerns | Implement virtualization |

**Future Optimizations** (if needed):
1. Virtual scrolling (react-window)
2. Pagination with infinite scroll
3. Lazy loading of resource groups
4. Debounced search in hook

### Files Modified During Review

None - code review only.

### Gate Status

**Gate: CONCERNS** → `docs/qa/gates/6.5-resource-library-page.yml`

**Status Reason:** Comprehensive and well-architected resource library with excellent features, but lacks test coverage for complex data aggregation and filtering logic. Missing fuse.js dependency verification.

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required** - Tests needed before production, especially for data aggregation logic.

**Rationale:**
1. **Missing Tests**: Complex aggregation logic needs comprehensive testing
2. **Data Integrity Risk**: Context mapping must be validated (phase/module relationships)
3. **Dependency Verification**: Must confirm fuse.js installed
4. **Integration Testing**: Server/client component interaction needs validation

**Positive Notes:**
- Code quality is outstanding
- Feature-complete implementation
- Excellent UX with multiple views and filters
- Proper Next.js 14 patterns (SSR + client components)
- SEO-optimized
- Accessibility considerations present
- Performance well-considered

**This is the most polished story in the epic** - comprehensive implementation with thoughtful design decisions. The only concern is testing.

**Blockers for Production:**
1. Add comprehensive test suite
2. Verify fuse.js dependency
3. Test data aggregation accuracy
4. Test all grouping and filtering combinations

**Next Steps:**
1. Add testing framework (if not done for US6.1-6.4)
2. Prioritize tests for aggregation logic
3. Test all filter/grouping combinations
4. Add page integration tests
5. Verify dependency installation
6. Re-submit for QA review
