### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Post-Deployment:**
   - Verify GA4 property is receiving data
   - Set up custom reports for key events
   - Configure conversion events if applicable
   - Set up data retention settings

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - Create funnel for phase progression
   - Track which resources are most downloaded
   - Monitor video engagement rates
   - Analyze language preference distribution

3. **Future Enhancements:**
   - Add scroll depth tracking
   - Track time spent on each module
   - Implement error tracking
   - Add search tracking when search feature is built
   - Consider A/B testing integration

- No tracking in development (better dev experience)
- Async script loading via next/script

### Conclusion

Comprehensive Google Analytics 4 implementation with all acceptance criteria met. The implementation follows privacy best practices with IP anonymization and no PII tracking. All major user interactions are tracked with proper event categorization. The code quality is excellent with proper TypeScript types and reusable functions.
