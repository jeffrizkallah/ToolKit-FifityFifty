## User Story

**As an** Admin  
**I want to** upload and store downloadable resources in cloud storage  
**So that** users can reliably download PDFs, templates, and checklists

- Set proper content-type headers for file downloads
- Environment variable: `STORAGE_BUCKET_URL`

## Implementation Summary

**Deliverables Created:**
- `/docs/setup/FILE_STORAGE_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive cloud storage setup guide
- `/strapi-cms/config/plugins.js` - Strapi plugin configuration with upload provider options
- Updated environment variable documentation

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Multi-Provider Support Configured:**
   - **AWS S3** - Full production setup guide with IAM, bucket policies, and CORS
   - **Vercel Blob** - Quick setup option for prototyping
   - **Cloudinary** - Alternative for media-heavy projects
   - **Local Storage** - Default for development

2. **Strapi Upload Plugin Configuration:**
   - Created `plugins.js` with configuration templates for all providers
   - Supports multiple storage backends through provider system
   - File size limit set to 10 MB (configurable)
   - Proper security configurations included

3. **AWS S3 Production Setup:**
   - Detailed bucket creation guide
   - IAM user with least-privilege permissions
   - Public read-only bucket policy for downloads
   - CORS configuration for cross-origin downloads
   - Optional CloudFront CDN integration
   - Security best practices documented

4. **File Type Support:**
   - PDF documents and guides
   - Excel files (.xlsx, .xls) for templates
   - Word documents (.docx, .doc) for checklists
   - Extensible for additional formats

5. **Security Measures:**
   - Public read, private write access model
   - HTTPS enforcement
   - Content-Type header validation
   - File size limits
   - Recommended virus scanning integration
   - Bucket versioning for recovery

6. **Environment Variables:**
   - `STORAGE_BUCKET_URL` for frontend (public URL)
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` for Strapi (secret)
   - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` for Strapi (secret)
   - `AWS_REGION` for Strapi
   - `AWS_BUCKET_NAME` for Strapi
   - All documented in ENV_VARIABLES.md

7. **Testing & Troubleshooting:**
   - Upload testing procedures
   - Download verification steps
   - Common issues and solutions
   - CORS troubleshooting guide

8. **Cost Optimization:**
   - S3 Lifecycle policies guidance
   - Intelligent-Tiering recommendations
   - File compression best practices
   - Usage monitoring setup

**CMS Integration:**
- Resource content type already includes `file` field (Strapi Media)
- Resource content type includes `file_url` field for direct URLs
- `file_type` field supports PDF, Excel, Word, Other
- `file_size` field for displaying size to users

**Frontend Integration:**
- Module page already configured to display resources
- Download functionality implemented with proper attributes
- File URLs constructed from CMS data or STORAGE_BUCKET_URL
- Works with both Strapi-hosted and external URLs

**Setup Instructions:**
Admins can choose their preferred storage provider and follow the step-by-step guide in FILE_STORAGE_SETUP.md. The system works with:
1. Default local storage (no configuration needed for development)
2. AWS S3 (recommended for production)
3. Vercel Blob (easiest cloud option)
4. Cloudinary (for media-heavy use cases)

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test file upload in Strapi admin panel
- Verify files are accessible via public URL
- Test download functionality in frontend
- Check CORS headers for cross-origin downloads
- Verify file size limits
- Test with all supported file types (PDF, XLSX, DOCX)
- Ensure proper Content-Type headers are set
