# Deployment Fixes - October 20, 2025

## Summary
Fixed all TypeScript errors and build issues to ensure smooth Vercel deployment.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. TypeScript Configuration
- **Issue**: CMS and Strapi-CMS folders were being included in TypeScript compilation
- **Fix**: Updated `tsconfig.json` to exclude:
  - `cms/`
  - `strapi-cms/`
  - `vitest.config.ts`
  - `vitest.setup.ts`

### 2. Analytics trackDownload Function
- **Issue**: `trackDownload()` expected 3 parameters but only received 1
- **Fix**: Updated function calls to pass:
  - `resourceName` (string)
  - `fileType` (string)
  - `moduleSlug` (string)
- **Files Modified**:
  - `app/[locale]/resources/ResourceLibraryClient.tsx`
  - `components/ResourceLibrary.tsx`

### 3. Unused Imports and Variables
Fixed strict TypeScript errors for unused variables and imports:
- **CookieConsent.tsx**: Removed unused `X` icon, `getConsent`, and `useTranslations`
- **Footer.tsx**: Removed unused `isRTL` variable
- **GoogleAnalytics.tsx**: Removed unused `getConsent` import
- **ProgressIndicator.tsx**: Removed unused `useTranslations` call
- **ResourceLibrary.tsx**: Removed unused `Link` and `Button` imports
- **useResourceLibrary.ts**: Removed unused `Module` type and `label` variable
- **useSearch.ts**: Removed unused `Module` type, fixed Fuse type import

### 4. Locale Parameters
- **Issue**: Several components had unused `locale` parameters
- **Fix**: Prefixed with underscore to indicate intentionally unused:
  - `ResourceCard`
  - `FileTypeFilter`
  - `GroupBySelector`

### 5. CMS Offline Mode for Build
- **Issue**: Build failed when trying to fetch from CMS that wasn't running
- **Solution**: Use `CMS_OFFLINE=true` environment variable during build
  - The CMS client already has offline mode support
  - Falls back to sample data in `strapi-cms/sample-data/`

## Deployment Instructions for Vercel

### Option 1: Using CMS Offline Mode (Recommended for initial deployment)
```bash
# Set environment variable in Vercel
CMS_OFFLINE=true
```

This will use sample data and allow the site to deploy immediately.

### Option 2: With Live CMS (Production)
Set these environment variables in Vercel:
```bash
CMS_BASE_URL=https://your-strapi-cms-url.com
CMS_API_TOKEN=your_production_api_token
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://toolkit.fiftyfifty.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-YOUR-GA-ID
```

## Build Command
```bash
# For local testing with offline mode:
CMS_OFFLINE=true npm run build

# For production (requires CMS):
npm run build
```

## All Issues Resolved ✅
- ✅ TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ Unused imports and variables
- ✅ Function signature mismatches
- ✅ CMS fetch errors during build
- ✅ Build completes successfully

## Next Steps
1. Commit these changes to git
2. Push to main branch
3. Deploy to Vercel with `CMS_OFFLINE=true` environment variable
4. Later, connect live CMS and remove `CMS_OFFLINE` variable
